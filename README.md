Hi, I’m @viktm128

Overview: This repo is largely a place for my personal projects. Recently, I've been exploring how compilers work and have been studying Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. Last year, I completed the standard ML introductory project recognizing handwritten digits with ~98% accuracy. During my BS, I worked in an aviation and human factors research lab where I programmed a UAV simulator to monitor human-automation interactions and integrate hardware into a Boeing 737-800 flight simulator. In the future, I'd like to learn more about how high-frequency trading algorithms operate.

Background / Education: I will be attending Columbia University in 2024 to compete my MS in Financial Engineering. Before grad school, I was working as a high school math teacher in Providence, RI to help improve educational equity outcomes. Before that, I got my BS in Mathematics with Honors and Distinction with minors in Economics and Computer Science. I am still doing causal research into Bergman theory in my free time and am hoping to publish a paper soon!

Contact: I can be reached at vikram dot t dot mathew at gmail dot com.
