Hi, I’m @viktm128

I am currently a high school math teacher in Providence Public Schools. I am interested in eventually pursuing graduate work in Mathematics and Economics. I graduated from the University of Michigan in 2020 where I studied Math, Econ, and CS.
For now I am mostly here so I can try to build a website.
I can be reached at vikram dot t dot mathew at gmail dot com.
